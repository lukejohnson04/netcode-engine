TODO:

The client is receiving snapshots slightly into the future. This should never happen!
When removing the sleep commands this works fine. One option is increasing snapshot buffer, but that's not ideal, we need to get to the bottom of the problem!

TODO:

convert game_start_time to a LARGE_INTEGER, fix rubber banding and weird delays

timer is 100% synced tho! at least!!!

TODO:

Figure out automatic segment generation for walls when the level is initally loaded
There's 100% chance someone has done this before and writing about it on the internet... so, yeah.

Then take the unique points from all segments. This way we can much faster iterate over all segments and all points.

Iterate through all points, append the angle to it along with +0.00001 and -0.00001 radians. Sort by clockwise
Iterate through all angles. Detect collision point.

THEN we can either iterate through all collision points to draw triangles, OR draw triangles inline with the collision detection. This would make it O(n) instead of O(2n).

TODO:

Convert rendering from SDL_Renderer to OpenGL so we can use shaders
