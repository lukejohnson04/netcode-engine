TODO

- Make it so you can run the game on an automatic listen server (i.e. maybe a compiler debug flag, so you don't need any connection whatsoever to run the game, or at least don't need to input any connection info like ip and port. That way we won't have to wait for a connection everytime when debugging) [x]
- Research data structures and techniques for limitting the data sent over the internet for world synchronization [ ]
- Figure out hitches in packet reception (the server goes through lulls where it consistently only sends 75% of the necessary packets, or 80% of the packets, or 50% of the packets etc) [ ]
