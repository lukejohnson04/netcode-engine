Modern Joshfare pitch

Playing a roguelike creates a dopamine feedback loop of a new twist every game. Battle royale games suck because its too many people and you don't really need to work as a team all that much- there are too many variables to account for. Modern Joshfare takes the good of both roguelikes and competitive shooters like CSGO or Siege.

Every game is a new procedurally generated map
5v5 or 4v4 or 3v3 (number to be determined)

Both teams have a beacon on opposite sides of the map, which they can respawn from. If the beacon is destroyed, deaths become permanent. Explore the environment, craft, and use the resources you find to build a fortress around the beacon. Attack the enemy as soon as you'd like, but you'll need to prepare against extreme temperatures, crossing a river, or a third example of nature getting in the way.
